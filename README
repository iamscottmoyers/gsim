navvie  - navvie is my program that can convert .uml files into graphviz format or C. It depends upon libxml2 so you
          might want to get that first. To run it try this:

          cd navvie
          make
          mkdir tmp
          ./navvie ../aire/aire.uml tmp > out.dot

          That will put the C output in the tmp directory. At the moment the graphviz .dot file is printed to stdout so
          that will be redirected to out.dot. To create a .png from out.dot (assuming you have graphviz installed) do:

          dot -Tpng out.dot > out.png

vhdl    - The very start of a vhdl parser. You'll need antlr3 installed somewhere. You need to set the classpath. e.g.

          export CLASSPATH=/home/scott/bin/antlrworks-1.4.3.jar
          cd vhdl
          make
          vhdl input.vhd

verilog - A verilog parser, I got an example parser and fixed the warnings it was giving. Again you'll need antlr3
          installed somewhere and you need to set the classpath (the -cp path in the Makefile).

          cd verilog
          make
          verilog input.v

aire    -
          cd navvie
          make
          mkdir tmp
          ./navvie ../aire/aire.uml tmp > out.dot
          cd tmp
          patch -p1 < ../../aire/aire_cpp.patch
          make
